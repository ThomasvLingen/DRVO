## Labs
The labs are ordered chronologically by chapter, a labs folder contains all produced sources
Progress is also noted down in the LOG.md file

## Tests
Some labs may also have test associated with them to test the written driver,
to run these, use `nosetests`. **Keep in mind that most tests will assume that
the devicenode named in the Makefile is present in `/dev`**
